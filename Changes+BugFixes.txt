INTERSNP VERSION 1.11

Major update with multiple bugfixes and performance optimizations.

INTERSNP-RARE (beta): Genome-Wide Rare Variant Analysis

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERSNP VERSION 1.0.10

Added CaseOnly4DF function

Added IBS matrix: definition of outliers and relatives is possible
Added config-parameters for IBS analysis
Converting IBS-determination to binary-format

Added new pathway score: InteractionRatio “number of significant pairs / number of SNP pairs per pathway”.

Binary coding to speed up the analysis with INTERSNP

Changes in several functions because of the binary coding
-> modified functions: qtreg, logreg, anova1df, anova4df

Added pretest for interaction test 4 and 6

fixed some bugs with Combilist and 3-marker
bug fixed: Simulation and 3-Marker-Analysis

Added Sidak correction instead of Bonferroni
fixed lacks of the memory management

Improved some output
output-file linear regression: added rquare and Fstat
small changes in singlemarker output

PLINK binary files are now readable
ped/map files are now readable

added p-value filter (PFILTER)

bug fix combilist

Bug fixed in 3-marker-analysis + simulations
Bug fixed in Singlemarker 1 with Chr X

added caseOnly20DF and caseOnly20DF_X

More than 10 covariates are allowed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERSNP VERSION 1.0.9
A bug that occured when the parallel-Version of INTERSNP was used for quantitative trait data 
together with the PATHWAY priority was fixed.

Singlemarker analysis is now working correctly when HAPLO (haplotype analysis) is selected.

Now there is no limit for the first line.

Pathway Association Analysis was added in the documentation.
